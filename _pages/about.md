I am an Assistant Professor at Tokyo University of Science, Chiba, Japan.

My academic work focuses on **compiler optimization** to improve the efficiency of programs, including speedup, saving energy, and code size reduction.
In particular, I am currently interested in code optimization for **GPUs** (Graphics Processing Units) and the **RISC-V** architecture.

I am also interested in high-performance computing, parallel processing, embedded systems, machine learning, and Inductive Logic Programming (Explainable AI, XAI).
